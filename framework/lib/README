This are only compile-time libraries.
To actually use OpenID with Wandledi there are number of
other JARs required. Refer to the example project to see which.

The Servlet API on the other hand will probably not be required (within your lib dir) to run
a Wandledi application, since the servlet container on which it is deployed
should provide the necessary API.

Exchange the JPA provider with the one you like for deployment.

You will also need Jetty by the way.
